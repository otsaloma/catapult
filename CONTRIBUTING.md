Contributing to Catapult
========================

## Plugins and Themes

Please note that, in general, new plugins and themes to the Catapult
codebase are not accepted. The goal is to keep the core Catapult light
and include only a consistent set of well maintained plugins and themes
that can be expected to be of wide interest.

So, if you need a new plugin or theme, the general suggestion is that
you do that in your own repository, maintaining and distributing it
yourself. You can add the topic "catapult-plugin" or "catapult-theme" to
your repository and users will then find them following links on the
Catapult website and README.
