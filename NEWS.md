2025-07-18: Catapult 1.2
========================

* Add characters plugin to copy characters and emojis
* Make all plugins work with space-separated multi-part queries where

  find "UNICODE GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON"

==========================

* Don't make build depend on flake8

2024-04-03: Catapult 1.0
========================

* Remember choices also for prefixes of search query, e.g. if searching
  for "music", also save choice for "musi", "mus", "mu" and "m" (this
  should help avoid results jumping back and forth in certain cases)
* Limit results returned per plugin (default 24) to avoid issues with
  huge file indexes paired with short query strings (#23)
* Use `xdg-screensaver lock` in the session plugin to lock the screen in
  GNOME (instead of the earlier `gnome-screensaver-command --lock`)
* Update installation to use just a Makefile and a private package
  under $PREFIX/share/catapult

* Drop Keybinder, users need to do the keybinding themselves
* Window positioning on screen no longer works, users can configure
  their own window manager to center all new windows
* See the updated README regarding the above regressions
* Show window initially by default, remove `--show`, add `--hide` (if
  you have Catapult configured to start when you login to your desktop,
  you probably want to add `--hide` there)
* Add dependency on the gapplication binary (part of GLib, but might
  be packaged separately, e.g. libglib2.0-bin on Debian)

2022-10-03: Catapult 0.5
========================

* Add a clipboard history plugin (default trigger "cc", requires a
  clipboard manager source, currently supports gpaste)
* Update apps plugin index every time the launcher window is shown,
  making new installed apps show up instantly in search results (#13)
* Specify limited API for plugins under `catapult.api`
* When installing, don't relay `PREFIX` to `setup.py` as many distros
  interpret that differently. Use `SETUP_PREFIX` separately if needed,
  e.g. for building a distro package, you could use something like `make
  DESTDIR=pkg PREFIX=/usr SETUP_PREFIX=/usr install`. See `Makefile` for
  details.
* Raise Python dependency to 3.8 or greater
