Catapult is an app launcher for Linux. It allows you to easily launch
apps, open files and do basic calculations with a keyboard-driven user
interface. Custom plugins and themes can be loaded dynamically.

Catapult is Free Software released under the GNU General Public License
(GPL), see the file [`COPYING`](COPYING) for details. Small parts of the
code have been adapted from [Ulauncher][], likewise GPL. These are
indicated file-wise in the license headers of individual files.

## Documentation

### Keybinding to Activate Catapult

Catapult cannot do a global toggle keybinding for you, instead you need
to do it yourself in your desktop/distro settings. Catapult is a
single-instance app, so simply executing `catapult` will show the
existing instance and that is the command you can bind to your key of
choice.

* [GNOME](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/keyboard-shortcuts-set.html.en)

### Window Position on Screen

Catapult cannot position its own window on your screen, which means that
it will be positioned wherever your window manager defaults to or
considers appropriate. You can configure your window manager to center
all new windows by default, which should center the Catapult window too
(excluding the search results).

* GNOME: `gsettings set org.gnome.mutter center-new-windows true`

### Starting Automatically

Use tools provided by your desktop/distro to set Catapult to start
automatically when you log in to your desktop. You can also create the
autostart file manually, usually under `~/.config/autostart`.

* [GNOME](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/shell-apps-auto-start.html.en)
* [Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/startup-applications.html.en)

### Customizing the Theme

Since Catapult 0.6, you can override parts of the theme by editing
`~/.config/catapult/user.css`, a file which is created the first time
you start Catapult 0.6 or later. You can edit the file while Catapult is
running and use `:reload-theme` in Catapult to apply the changes.

For example, to use the GNOME default font (Cantarell) for everything,
you can use

```css
.catapult-input-entry {
  font-family: "Cantarell", sans-serif;
}

.catapult-search-result-title {
  font-family: "Cantarell", sans-serif;
}

.catapult-search-result-description {
  font-family: "Cantarell", sans-serif;
}
```

Or, to use Ubuntu orange as the selection color, try

```css
@define-color selected-bg-color #e95420;
```
